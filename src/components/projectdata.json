        "descr": "This is the final project I completed for the Penn LPS Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was as a group to create a complete React.js application from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Myself and two classmates began meeting and discussing what our application should do. We developed the idea of a D&D character creator which would enable a casual player of the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons to create a character easily and save it to an editable database. After wireframing the basic usability in Figma I was given the task to complete and connect the backend using GraphQL and MongoDB. We completed the project on time and the final presentation went flawlessly. I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a small amount of time."

Sometimes deciding on a meal is one of the hardest things to do when planning your week. With our application the user can plan out their week by planning specific meals on specific days. These meals can be deleted and re-added at the click of a button. The user also has the ability to add multiple dishes for specific meals. The application also has the ability to send a welcome e-mail when the user signs up for the service. The technologies we used to complete this application are bcrypt, Sequelize, Handlebars, MySQL, and Express    "
