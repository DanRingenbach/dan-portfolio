The assignment was as a group to create a complete React.js application from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Myself and two classmates began meeting and discussing what our application should do. We developed the idea of a D&D character creator which would enable a casual player of the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons to create a character easily and save it to an editable database. After wireframing the basic usability in Figma I was given the task to complete and connect the backend using GraphQL and MongoDB. We completed the project on time and the final presentation went flawlessly. I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a small amount of time."},{"name":"Work Day Scheduler","link":"https://github.com/DanRingenbach/05-Work-Day-Scheduler","deploy":"https://danringenbach.github.io/05-Work-Day-Scheduler/","image":"https://freerangestock.com/sample/120630/flat-lay-of-a-calendar-on-the-table.jpg","descr":"The task of this assignment was to create a simple daily scheduling web application.

These meals can be deleted and re-added at the click of a button. The user also has the ability to add multiple dishes for specific meals. The application also has the ability to send a welcome e-mail when the user signs up for the service.
